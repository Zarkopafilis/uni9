Hi there, this is a cloud9 vps. Evdoxos sucks. Centos sucks. It should be ubuntu,
not centos nor redhat enterprise jesus. No superuser permissions = rip for a
normal software developer. Bro they don't even allow us to use a normal IDE.
Use pico or vim they said.... Gosh! At least we've got git and make installed.
These piece of shit VMs still run java 6. I'll use my trusty 160$ chromebook
to do all the assignments at c9 or on my desktop. Just pull em and maybe
make/mvn package crap in order to work.
